"""MkDocs hooks that make the documentation site read the documents as GitHub does.

The site is built from the Markdown documents where they are in the
repository (mkdocs.yml), and the documents are written for GitHub, so:

- docs/index.md is the site's home page, index.html at the root, and a
  README.md keeps its own URL (analyzer/README.html), as foo.md becomes
  foo.html, instead of MkDocs' index.html. The root README.md is the
  GitHub overview and is not a page (mkdocs.yml excludes it). `on_files`
  sets both.
- Every heading gets the id GitHub gives it. The documents link to sections
  by GitHub's anchors and tools/check_doc_links.py checks the links against
  them; Python-Markdown's toc differs for repeated headings (`added_1` where
  GitHub has `added-1`) and drops text inside `<...>` in a code span.
  `on_page_content` sets the ids from the check's own `heading_anchors()`,
  on the headings, their permalinks, the page's table of contents and the
  set of ids MkDocs checks links to anchors against.
- A code span keeps the spaces at its ends that CommonMark keeps
  (` requested=<id>`, `#### `); Python-Markdown strips them, and some
  documents quote exact prefixes and suffixes that way. `on_page_markdown`
  writes such a span as an HTML <code> element, its end spaces as no-break
  spaces so the browser does not collapse them.
- A link to a file that is not a page (CLAUDE.md, LICENSE, a script) or to a
  directory points at that path on GitHub, as it does when the document is
  read there. `on_page_content` rewrites it.

Standard library only; the MkDocs objects are used by attribute.
